Geography differs from the\ndiscipline of geology because geology focuses mainly on the physical Earth and\nthe processes that formed and continue to shape it. On the other hand, geography\ninvolves a much broader approach to examining the Earth, as it involves the study\nof humans as well. As such, geography has two major subdivisions, human\n(social science) and physical (natural science). This text focuses primarily\non human geography, but because the physical aspects affect humans and vice versa,\nphysical geography will not be completely excluded, but will receive less emphasis.\n\nGeography is the study of the physical and environmental aspects of the world,\nfrom a spatial perspective. As geographers study the Earth, the one element that\nbinds the discipline of geography and makes it unique is studying the Earth from\na spatial perspective. The spatial perspective means that the phenomenon you are\nstudying can be displayed on a map, so geography focuses on places around the\nworld. Geography, then, is a physical (or natural) and social science that asks\nthe fundamental questions, \u201cWhat is where, and why?\u201d Human geography is a\nsocial science that focuses on people, where they live, their ways of life, and their\ninteractions in different places around the world. A simple example of a geographic\nstudy in human geography would be where is the Hispanic population concentrated\nin the U.S., and why? A physical geography research endeavor might ask where do\nmost hurricanes strike the U.S. coastline, and why? In addition, because the Earth\nis dynamic, geographers also look at how places change through time, and why, so\nthere is a natural connection with history.\n\n1.2.1 Geography and its relationship to other disciplines\n\nNot only is there a connection between geography and history, but geography\nis also related to a broad range of other academic disciplines (Figure 1.1).

The\nseale of a map is a ratio of the length or distance on the map versus the length or\ndistance on the Earth or ground (actual). The amount of detail shown on a map\nwill vary based on the scale. For example, a map with a scale of 1:100,000 (which\nmeans 1 in/em on the map equals 1,000,000 in/cem on the ground) would show\nmuch less detail than a map at a scale of 1:10,000 (Figure 1.3). Besides showing\nseale as a ratio, it can also be presented as a bar graph or as a verbal statement.\nScale can also mean the spatial extent of some kind of phenomena.

The Southern\nregion, then, may be thought of as a vernacular (or perceptual) region because the\nboundaries of these types of regions depend on the perspectives or mental maps\nof different groups of people who live both outside or inside that region. Hence,\nthe concept of regions and their definition is not a straightforward process and\ninvolves generalities and varying opinions.\n"

From the ime 0: mas\nMalthus (quoted above), modern humans have acknowledged the rapidly expanding\nhuman population and its relationship with the food supply. Malthus himself was\na cleric in England who spent much of his time studying political economy. His\nviews were a product not only of his time, but also of his place. In Malthus\u2019 case his\ntime and place were a time of social, political, and economic change.\n\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) took issue with Malthus\u2019 ideas. Marx wrote that\npopulation growth alone was not responsible for a population's inability to feed\nitself, but that imbalanced social, political, and economic structures created\nartificial shortages. He also believed that growing populations reinforced the\npower of capitalists, since large pools of underemployed laborers could more easily\nbe exploited.\n\nThe post-World War II period saw a flurry of books warning of the dangers\nof population growth with books like Fairfield Osborn's Our Plundered Planet\nand William Vogt's Road to Survival. Perhaps most explicit was Paul and Anne\nEhrlich\u2019s The Population Bomb.\n\nThese books are warnings of the dangers of unchecked population growth.\nMalthus wrote that populations tend to grow faster than the expansion of food\nproduction and that populations will grow until they outstrip their food supplies.\nThis is to say that starvation, war, and disease were all predictions of Malthus\nand were revived in these Neo-Malthusian publications. Some part of the current\nconversation of environmentalism regards limiting the growth of the human\npopulation, echoing Malthus.\n\nAcommon theme of these books is that they all attempt to predict the future.\nOne of the advantages we have living centuries or decades after these books is the\nopportunity to see if these predictions were accurate or not. Ehrlich\u2019s book predicted\nthat by the 1970s, starvation would be widespread because of food shortages and\na collapse in food production. That did not happen. In fact, the global disasters\npredicted in all these books have yet to arrive decades later. What saved us?\n\nPerhaps nothing has saved us. We have just managed to push the reckoning a\nbit further down the road.\n\nIf we have been saved, then the assumptions inherent in the predictions were\nwrong. What were they?\n\nlom_text 0.28|\n"

This number is derived by\ncounting a mother and her partner, and accounts for thase who never reproduce.\n\nPlaces with a fertility rate below 2.1 will shrink over Lime. Those places above\nthat will grow, and those well above that will grow quickly (Figure 2.10). The\npreceding graphic demonstrates that in the same way that many places are growing\nvery rapidly, many places are at or below replacement. The United States is below\nreplacement. It is demographically buoyed by immigration.\n\nWhat kinds of places are growing fastest? These are places that are poor or\neconomically or politically unstable. This may seem counterintuitive. Why would\npeople have children in places that are already so poor? Remember that individual\nfamilies have children. Children can seem like a mechanism for surviving bad\nsituations. What kinds of places are declining? This is more complicated, but\nin general the more educated and empowered the female population is, the\nlower the birth rate. This isn\u2019t a perfect, linear relationship, but it's useful as a\nstart. Why is there so much variability? Because places matter.

There are many of these and each has its merits.\n\nArithmetic density is the simplest one. It is simply the number of people\ndivided by the area of the country.

Do you know\nor think you know when your ancestors arrived? Can you visualize the time period\nduring which they first came to North America? Which population groups are not\nincluded in the chart? Why do you think this might be?\n\nThere four distinct phases of immigration, but let's examine each one briefly.\nFirst, during the cra of frontier expansion (1820-1880), a rapid westward movement\noccurred. Settlers were given the rare opportunity to acquire large amounts of\ngood farmland in the \u201cNew World,\u201d which pushed people out of the large cities like\nNew York and Boston and towards the American Midwest into the future states of\nOhio, Illinois, lowa, Nebraska, etc. Many immigrants came to the US specifically\nin search of land, because population pressure in Europe made land acquisition\nvery difficult. The Homestead Act of 1862 offered up to 160 acres of farmland to\ncitizens or those planning to become citizens as long as they continuously lived on\nand farmed the land for five years. More than 1.5 million claims for land were made\nin subsequent years, resulting in a massive movement of people. It was also during\nthis era that the transcontinental railroad was completed, linking the East Coast\nand West Coast for the first time in a meaningful way. Most immigrants during this\ntime came from England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. More than\n1.5 million also came from Ireland in just a ten-year period (1845-1855) when the\npotato crop failed due to blight (disease), a period known as the Great Hunger. The\nonly significant non-European immigrants arrived as a result of the Burlingame-\nSeward Treaty of 1868, which welcomed Chinese workers, as China also opened\nits borders to American businesses, students, and missionaries. Migration from\nChina was short-lived, however, during the subsequent era.\n"

Large-scale human\nsettlement and political development occurred much earlier than in Europe or\nin North America. Early Chinese civilizations had already emerged more than\n5,000 years ago, and many in Asia can trace ancestral lineages back thousands of\nyears as well. As such, Asia (for the most part) wasn't \u201cdiscovered,\u201d conquered, or\ncolonized during the time of European imperialism. Apart from a small number\nof missionaries, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, Asia did not become a major\ndestination for those from foreign lands (there are several notable exceptions,\nparticularly in the case of the British Empire). Second, most Asian countries\nsimply do not allow for permanent immigration, except in the case of marriage\n(which also can be a very slow and tedious process).

Countries that tend to have an abundance of working-age people\nalso tend to be early in stage 3 of the model. Countries like Mexico, Guatemala, the\nPhilippines, and India had large families a generation ago. As those children enter\ntheir working years, there are not enough jobs created due to an \u201coversupply\u201d of\nlaborers. Meanwhile, countries in late stage 4 find that because of low fertility rates\na generation earlier, the economy now faces a shortage of working-age residents to\ndo all kinds of jobs. Birth rates were high during the 1950's in the US, but as women\nhad fewer children in subsequent generations, fewer workers were entering the\nworkforce every year. Unsurprisingly, young workers from Mexico, El Salvador,\nJamaica, etc., began to immigrate as the demand for their labor increased. In\nEurope, the same pattern occurred as those from higher fertility countries like\nTurkey migrated to lower fertility countries tike Germany.\n3.4.2 Why do some countries benefit from migration while\nothers do not?\n\nDemographic realities can be push factors or pull factors that serve to push\npeople away from a place or pull them towards a place as explained in the previous\nparagraph.

Culture exists to answer questions.\nSome of the questions that are answered are philosophical or ideological, for\nexample, \u201cWhere did we come from?\u201d or \u201cWhat is acceptable behavior?\u201d Other\nquestions revolve around daily life. \u201cHow do we secure shelter, clothe ourselves,\nproduce food, and transmit information?\u201d Culture provides us with guidance for\nour lives. It both asks and answers questions. Children, from an early age, start\nasking \u201cWhat is my place in the world?\u201d Culture helps to answer that.\n\nThe word culture itself comes the Latin word cultura, meaning cultivation or\ngrowing. This is precisely what humans do with both their material and abstract\ncultural components. Humans, since early childhood, learn to shape, create, share,\nand change their culture. Culture is the very vehicle we use to navigate through our\nenvironments. Culture is a form of communication and it evolves. And as a type of\ncompass, it leads.\n"

It seems that anything with the prefix folk refers to\nsomething that somehow belongs in the past and that is relegated to festivals and\nmuseums. The word folk can be traced back to Old Norse/English/Germanic and was\nused to refer to an army, a clan, or a group of people. Using this historic information,\nfolk culture (folktales, folklore, etc.) can be understood as something that is shared\nfirst among a group of people and then with the more general population. It is a\nform of identification. Folk is ultimately tied to an original landscape/geographic\nlocation as well. Folk cultures are found in small, homogeneous groups. Because of\nthis, folk culture is stable through time, but highly variable across space.\n\nFolk customs originate in the distant past and change slowly over time. Folk\ncultures move across space by relocation diffusion, as groups move they bring their\ncultural items, as well as their ideas with them.\n\nFolk culture is transmitted or diffused in person. Knowledge is transmitted\neither by speaking to others, or through participating in an activity until it has been\nmastered. Cooking food is taught by helping others until an individual is ready to\nstart cooking. Building a house is learned through participating in the construction\nof houses. In all cases, folk cultures must leam to use the resources that are locally\navailable. Over time folk cultures learn functional ways to meet daily needs as well\nas satisfy desires for meaning and entertainment. Folk cultures produce distinctive\nways to address problems.\n"

Clothing\nis made from local wool, flax, hides, or other materials immediately available. Local\nplants serve as the basis of folk medicinal systems. People are entertained by music\nthat reinforces folk beliefs and mythologies, as well as reflects daily life. Folktales\nor folklore exists as foundational myths, origin stories or cautionary tales.\n\nHolidays provide another form of entertainment. Special days break the\nmonotony of daily life. A holiday such as Mardi Gras, which has its roots in the\nCatholic calendar provides an occasion to flout cultural norms and relieve tension.\nAnother way of providing escape from monotony is provided by intoxicants.\nAlthough often not considered when discussing culture, human beings have been\naltering their own mental states for millennia. The production of alcohol, cannabis,\ntobacco or coca demonstrates that folk cultures understood the properties of\npsychoactive substances.

The\ncommercialization of Christmas has been increasing for over a century in western\ncountries. Now it is possible to see Christmas displays in Japan or China, places\nwith few Christians, but many available consumers. The same sort of marketing\ncan be seen in the expansion of Halloween globally, and in the growth of Cinco de\nMayo in the United States.\n\nHierarchical diffusion plays prominently in popular culture diffusion. Larger\nplaces tend to generate many of pop culture's hit songs, clothing styles, and food\ntrends. Diffusion in popular culture is highly related to technology. Although\nit wasn't invented as such, the internet has become a venue for advertisement.\nClickbait headlines and ad revenue have created an atmosphere where every\nconversation is a sales pitch.\n\nThis hierarchical diffusion means that innovations tend to diffuse from large,\nwell-connected places to other large-well-connected places first, then trickle-down\nto smaller and smaller places. The gap in time that it takes for a new idea or product\nis known as cultural lag. In some places, there is almost no cultural lag. To very\nremote places, some innovations take a very long time to arrive. Bear in mind that\nthere are places in the United states that still have no internet service.\n\nPopular culture covers large populations with access to similar goods and\nservices, but the pressing need to sell drives almost incessant modification,\ngenerally at a superficial level. Because of this we usually describe pop culture as\nstable across space, but highly variable acrass time.\n"

The Russian climate was good\nfor producing grain and potatoes, which eventually was distilled into vodka.\n\nSelling culture goes well beyond just food and clothing.

This is also true of other mass media products.\nThese products are often related to other pop culture products. Companies rely on the\nfamiliarity consumers will have with a movie character in order to sell clothing, toys,\nvideo games, conventions and more movies in that series. When Marshall McLuhan\nwrote that \"The medium is the message\u201d he meant that television would be able to sell\nitself.

Commodification\nis the process in which a cultural attribute is changed into a mass-market product.\nBear in mind that the mass-market product may not resemble the original product\nvery much. Using a similar fast-food model as McDonald's, Taco Bell sells ostensibly\nMexican products across the world with the notable exception of Mexico. Panda\nExpress is similar for Chinese food. These chains are not in the business of making\nhamburgers, tacos, or orange chicken. They are in the business of making a profit.\nAuthenticity is irrelevant, and probably harmful in the drive to sell more.\n\nThe reverse of this process also applies. One aspect of marketing is the\nincorporation of global products into the local market. Companies will change their\nproducts or their entire product lines, if doing so is cast-eflective and generates a\ngood return on investment. There is even a Central America-based fried chicken\nchain in the United States. Brands like Sony and Hyundai are highly visible in the\nAmerican landscape.

This growing reality has created a newer type of popular culture,\nglobal culture.\n\nHistorically, popular culture was restricted to areas the size of States, or at\nthe very most areas within culturally related spheres (e.g. the English-speaking\nworld). United States culture was defined by a set of characteristics (language, law,\nsettler colonial history, etc.) that translated to a few other places, such as Canada\nor Australia, but mostly remained place bound. This is no longer the case. As was\nmentioned previously, video games are designed in one country to appeal to a\nglobal market. The same is true of music, movies, clothes, smartphones and office\nproductivity software.\n\nAt a superficial level at least, the components of life are becoming more\nhomogeneous across large parts of the world. National popular culture producers are\nmerging into international producers, and these international producers have global\nambitions. Any sizable popular culture content distributor (EMI Records, Sony,\nVivendi Universal, AOL Time Wamer and BMG) is a transnational corporation. In\nfact, the five listed global record labels account for 90% of global music sales.\n\nStarbucks, Toyota, Wyndham and others have helped reduce the friction of\ndistance by reducing spatial variation. They aren't doing this to help people, or to\nhurt them. Although they will cater to local needs to some degree, they are not in\nthe business of promoting local flavors.\n"

There are still people living\nin remote arcas practicing something similar to a paleolithic lifestyle. On the other\nend of the scale there are people with great wealth who have access to powerful\ntechnologies and are able to live anywhere they desire.\n\nSometimes globalization even has an effect on folk culture. In many places,\neconomic realities have forced people to perform religious activities of relive\nspecial events for tourist dollars. Attending luaus in Hawaii or watching voladores\nin Veracruz in a quest for authenticity is in itself changing the folk culture that is\nthe center of attention.\n\nThis assessment may seem particularly bleak for folk culture, but it isn't\nnecessarily completely bad. People survive, and they try to keep the practices that\nare most valuable to their lives. Folk cultures have a much longer timeline than\npop cultures, and have proven to be resilient.\n\n4.8 RESISTANCE TO POPULAR CULTURE\n\nAlthough popular culture has been expanding rapidly at the expense of folk\nculture, it is not without resistance. Although it is not strictly-speaking true, global\nculture is perceived as largely corporate, secular, and western. Each of these aspects\nhave their own critics.\n\nAnti-globalists fall into two main groups. The first are leftists who oppose the\npower that has accumulated to corporations and the authoritarian state. The other\ngroup are rightists who prefer that power be centered at the state level, and who\nfear that globalization naturally undermines state sovereignty.\n\nIn some places, globalization is the same thing as modernization is the same\nthing as westernization which is perceived as secular (oreven atheistic), materialistic\nand corrupt. Movements such as Al-Qaeda or Islamic State are violently opposed\n{o popular culture, although they would not have a problem if their idea of the ideal\nculture were to become fully global. Rejecting modern popular culture often also\ninvolves clevating a nostalgic, often imaginary golden age as the only acceptable\n\niety.\n"

As human beings, we are able to produce and understand countless\nnumber of utterances which are characterized by the use of grammatical clements\nsuch as words, phrases and sentences,\n\nWith a limited number language forms, we can produce numerous utterances\nthat can be easily understood by other members of the speech community who\nshare a similar cultural background and language knowledge. This underlying\nmental capacity is embodied in the concept that language is rule-governcd\ncreativity, operating al different grammatical levels in the formation of utterances\nor sentences.\n\nTo illustrate, many examples of utterances or sentences can be derived using a\nlimited set lexical and grammatical words as listed below.\n"

English speakers from England, Canada, Australia,\nNew Zealand and United States of America will generally agree that they speak\nEngtish, and this is also confirmed with the use of a standard written form of the\nlanguage and a common literary heritage. However, there are many other cases in\nwhich speakers will not agree when the question of national identity and mutual\nintelligibility do not coincide.\n\nThe most common situation is when similar spoken language varicties are\nmutually understandable, but for political and historical reasons, they are regarded\nas different languages as in the case of Scandinavian languages. While Swedes,\nDanes and Norwegians can communicate with each other in most instances, each\nnational group admits speaking a different language: Swedish, Danish, Norwegian\nand Icelandic. There are other cases in which political, ethnic, religious, literary\nand other factors force a distinction between similar language varieties: Hindi vs.\nUrdu, Flemish vs. Dutch, Serbian vs. Croatian, Gallego vs. Portuguese, Xhosa vs\nZulu.

Contagious diffusion is also seen in languages, particularly in\nthe adoption of new expressions in a language. One of the most obvious examples\nhas been in the current convergence of British and American English. The British\npress has published books' and articles\u2019 decrying the Americanization of British\nEngtish, while the American press has done the same thing in reverse\u2018.

A pidgin may become a creole language when the size of the\nvocabulary increases, grammatical structures become more complex and children\nlearn it as their native language or mother tongue. There are cases in which one\nexisting language gains the status of a lingua franca. A lingua franca may\nnot necessarily be the mother tongue of any one speaker group, but it serves as\nthe medium of communication and commerce among diverse language groups.\nSwahili, for instance, serves as a lingua franca for much of East Africa, where\nindividuals speak other local and regional languages.\n\nWith increased globalization and interdependence among nations, English is\nrapidly acquiring the status of lingua franca for much of the world. In Europe,\nAfrica and India and other geographic regions, English serves as a lingua franca\nacross many national-state boundaries. The tinguistic con- sequence results in\ncountless numbers of speaker groups who must become bilingual (the ability to use\ntwo languages with varying degrees of fluency) to participate more fully in society.\n\nSome continents have more spoken languages than others.

The\nOther category contains newer religions that are just gaining their footholds and\nother religions that may be fading in the contemporary milicu. Judaism is included\nin the chart, although it has comparatively few adherents. It is included for two\nreasons. First, it provided the cultural spoor for both Christianity and Islam, and\nsecond, it is the predominant religion of the modern state of Israel.\n\nIn some places, religion can be considered a separate element of civil society, but in\nmany others, religion cannot be meaningfully separated from daily life or governance.\n\nCharts such as this can be somewhat misleading, as can maps of religion\n(Figure 6.2). All these methods of tabulating religion rely on estimates with varying\ndegrees of accuracy. One problem is determining the predominance of a particular\nreligion. Does predominance require over fifty percent? What if no religion in a\ncountry has a majority? In the case of this map, if no religion has a majority, but\nthere are two large religions (for example Christianity and Islam in Nigeria) then\nthe country is split between the two. If there are numerous fragmented groups,\nthen the group with a plurality is used.\n\nIn some parts of the world, some forms of religious expression are discouraged\nor banned outright. For example, in North Korea, the state ideology is known as\nJuche, which is not a traditional religion with supernatural elements. The practice\nof Buddhism or Christianity in North Korea must necessarily be circumspect. In\nother places, religion has reached the status of being nominal (in name only) in\nwhich people identify with a religion, but the practices of that religion have little\n\ndaily lives.\n"

This is, of course,\nuntrue and it represents one of the problems with mapping anything- the level\nof aggregation.

New religions are founded and old ones\ndie out.\n\nNew religions are often made using pieces of older religions; Christianity and\nIslam deriving in part from Judaism and Buddhism deriving from Hinduism are\nnot aberrations, but instead are examples of a common occurrence.\n\nWithin the relatively recent past, it has been possible to watch the creation\nand diffusion of several new religions just within the United States. Mormonism,\nthe Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventism, and Scientology are all religions\nthat were founded in the U.S. in the relatively recent past.\n\n6.1.3 The Religious Contribution to Culture and Identity\n\nReligions are not isolated social phenomena. They exist within a cultural\ncomplex that nurtures and sustains them, or conversely, demeans and undermines\nthem. Religion can be closely bound to other clements of identity -language, or\nnationality. In many societies, the boundaries between religion and social life,\nfamily structure, and law and politics are nonexistent. Religion in those places is\nthe center of all life and everything else revolves around religious concepts. A place\nthat is purely governed by a religious structure is known as a theocracy. There are\nvery few of these in the modem world, although many states have strong religious\ninfluence. Many modern societies have built barriers between religious influence\nand political life. These places are called secular and are much more common in\nthe developed world.\n\nReligion, along with ethnicity and language, are very often core components\nof an individual's identity.

Anything that humans use to\ngenerate a sense of the divine can be considered a sacred space. Sacred spaces have\nexpectations of behavior.

Food production can be influenced by\nreligions. Many religions have doctrine regarding what is acceptable food, and what\nis not. Halal, Kosher and Ital are all representative of food restrictions. Religions\nthat prohibit the consumption of pork will probably not have swine farms. Cattle\nwander through the countryside in India, since they are religiously protected from\nharm. Another effect that religion has on the landscape is the effect of pilgrimage.\nMany religions have an activity that requires gathering at a particular place.\nProbably the best-known pilgrimage is the Hajj of Islam, but this isn't actually the\nlargest in the world. That would be the Hindu Kumbh Mela.

Through migration, both of these religions have become dispersed\naround much of the world, but they are closely tied to their own ethnic groups.\n\nUniversalizing religions seek to convert others. For some religions, it is\na requirement for practitioners to spend part of their lives in missionary work\nattempting to convert others.\n\nAnother way of dividing religions is into the categorics of polytheistic (many\ngods) and monotheistic (one god). Although the difference between monotheistic\nreligions and polytheistic religions seems unbridgeable, there are religions that\nhave managed to combine clements of polytheism and monotheism into the\nsame religion. For example, in Voudon (Voodoo), entities that had previously\nrepresented African gods are recast as Catholic saints, who themselves are semi-\ndivine in the Catholic cosmology.

Orthodox Christianity is mostly seen in Russia,\nEastern Europe, and Southern Europe with notable examples in Africa (Ethiopia)\nand in places where large numbers of people from these places have migrated (the\nUnited States, Canada). Catholic Christianity is seen in a wider range of places.\nIt largely formed around the historic Roman Empire, then spread to the north\nand west of Europe. Catholicism did not stop there, however. The age of colonial\nexpansion transplanted Catholicism to such widespread places as the Philippines,\nmuch of the Americas and Caribbean, and large parts of Africa. Protestantism is\nthe most recently developed Christian branch, but it has also diffused widely. The\ninitial Protestant countries were in northem Europe, but again due to colonialism,\nProtestant Christianity was exported to places like the United States, South Africa,\nGhana, and New Zealand. The current expansion of Christianity, particularly in\nAsia, is largely due to the growth of Protestantism.\n"

Another\nissue confronting the EU is whether or not to allow Turkey to join, as Greece has\nlong-standing disputes with Turkey over territory in Cyprus, and the Turkish\ncentral government has been accused of anti-democratic practices.

It\nis the sum of a nation\u2019s groas domestic product (GDP) and the net income\nit receives from overseas. GDP includes all of the goods and services produced\nwith a country in a given year and is calculated according to the following formula:\nConsumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net exports. So if a\ngovernment increases spending on the military or on road construction in a given\nyear that will increase GDP (and GNI). If a country imports a lot of things but\ndoesn\u2019t export many things, it will decrease that country\u2019s GDP (and GNI). Finally,\nif consumers buy a lot of alcohol for New Year's Eve, that will also increase GDP\n(and GNI). GNI also includes income derived outside of the country by members\nof the country. For example, Coca Cola, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, cams\nprofits in 200 different countries around the world. Those profits outside of the\nU.S. are not included in GDP, but they are included in GNL. It\u2019s a little confusing,\nbut this measure provides a valuable way to compare economic outputs between\nmultiple countries and is the metric that is most often used in recent years. The\ntotal GNI for a country is divided by the total population of that country to arrive\nat a per capita figure, which includes children, the elderly, those imprisoned,\netc. So, the figure of $12,476 does NOT mean that the average adult earns that\namount annually as income, but rather it represents total income and economic\noutput divided by the total population. Take a look at the cartogram in Figure\n9.3, which shows countries represented, not by their physical size, but by the size\nof their respective GNI.

As such, the\nstrategy became very popular among countries that gained independence after\nmany years of imperialism and colonization.

In both\ncountries, incomes are low, but life expectancy is high. In the case of Cuba, life\nexpectancy is higher than it is in the U.S. Cuba has followed a protectionist strategy\nfor several years, which has limited financial growth, but its provision of healthcare\nand education gives it a higher HD] than would otherwise be predicted.

HDI also has its limitations\nsince it uses only 4 indicators. Can you think of some other measure that might be\nmeaningful? Some examples might be gender empowerment, levels of inequality,\nor simply quality of life. Other indexes measure such things, and access to the\nInternet or to modern sanitation systems.

The rush to development has often hastened ecological\ncatastrophe, making it essential that future development efforts consider long-term\nsustainability as an anchor for decision-making in the 21st century and beyond.\n"

The world average consumption is 2,780 keal/day, but\nthere is a significant difference between developed countries, with an average of\n3,470 keal/day (3,800 kcal/day in the U_S.), and developing countries, recording\nan average of 2,630 kcal/day (even less in sub-Saharan countries). FAO estimates\nthat currently about 800 million people are undernourished globally, significantly\nless than in the early 1990s, but the majority continue to be counted in southern\nAsia and sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 10.28). One form of hunger is famine,\nan acute starvation caused even by a population's command over food resources,\nnatural disasters (c.g., drought, Ethiopia in 1984-1985), or wars. In contrast, in\nNorth America, the United States especially, where the food is abundant and\ninspected for quality, overeating is a national problem, the reason for which the\ngeneral condition of the population is reflected more by obesity (Figure 10.29).\n"

It was the result of centuries of incremental developments\nthat were assembled and deployed in the 18th century. Early industrialization\ninvolved using water power to run giant looms that produced cloth at a very low\ncost. This early manufacturing didn't use coal and belch smoke into the sky, but\nit initiated an industrial mindset. Costs could be reduced by relying on inanimate\npower (first water, then steam, then electricity), converting production to simple\nsteps that cheap low-skilled laborers could do (Tayloriam), getting larger and\nconcentrated in an area (economy of scale), and cranking out large numbers of the\nsame thing (Fordism). This is industry in a nutshell. The advantage of industry\nwas that a company could sell a cheaper product, but at a greater profit.\n\nAs this mindset was applied to other goods, and then services, the world was\nchanged forever. Places which had been producing goods for millennia suddenly\n(really suddenly) found themselves competing with a product that was far cheaper.\nEconomist Joseph Schumpeter coined the term \u201ccreative destruction\u201d to describe\nthe process in which new industries destroy old ones. Hand production of goods\nfor the masses began to decline precipitously. They quickly became too expensive\nin comparison to manufactured goods. Today, hand produced goods are often\nreserved for the wealthy.\n\nA contemporary example of the industrial mode of production is fast food.\nLooking inside the kitchen ofa fast food restaurant will reveal industrially prepared\n"

People loaded and unloaded goods ai break-of-bulk points. Break-of-\nbulk points were places like railroad terminals, where goods were loaded onto\ntrains, or ports, where goods were loaded into ships. Break-of-bulk points had\nlarge numbers of people loading and unloading items. Containerization changed\nthat process tremendously. Goods are now packed into large metal boxes, then\nthe bokes are moved from point to point. Cranes move the boxes from trucks to\ntrains to ships, then reverse the process the process at the shipping destination.\nIntermodal transportation assumes that a container will seamlessly be transported\nby any number of different shipping methods. The number of people necessary to\nship goods plummeted. The speed at which goods moved increased tremendously,\nsince the bottlenecks were removed from the system. Containerization is a good\nexample of an innovation that did not require a large technological shift, it simply\nrequired rationalizing a system that was labor intensive. Logistics, the commercial\nactivity of transporting goods, is the glue that holds the global production network\ntogether. Without relatively inexpensive shipping, many offshored industries\nwould not be able to make goods in distant factories, ship them to other places,\nand still make 4 profit.\n"

A word\nof caution is necessary here, however. As many choose to celebrate the freedom\nthat accompanies flexible work schedules, there is also a darker side in that the\ntraditional \u2018contract\u2019 and social cohesive element between workers and owners is\nvery much at risk. One defining factor of the 20th century was the development of\ncivil society that fought for and won a host of protective measures for workers, who\notherwise could face abusive work conditions. Child labor laws, minimum wage,\nenvironmental safety measures, overtime pay, and guards against discrimination\nwere all based upon an employer-employee relationship that seems increasingly\nthreatened by the gig economy. Uber drivers can work themselves to exhaustion\nsince they are not employees. AirBNB hosts can skirt environmental safety\nprecautions since they do not face the same safety inspections required at hotels.\nThese are just a few examples, but they are very worth consideration. Regardless\nof the positives and negatives, the new service economy is having a transformative\neffect upon all facets of society. Although, the authors of this textbook are all\ngeography professors with PhD's from a variety of universities, perhaps the next\nversion of this textbook will simply draw upon the gig economy to scek the lowest\ncost authors who are willing to write about all things geographical. Will you be able\nto tell the difference? (We hope so!!!)\n"

Historically, cities have been\ninfluenced by technological developments such as the steam engine, railroads,\nthe internal combustion engine, air transport, electronics, telecommunications,\nrobotics, and the internet. As the result of the global shift to technological-,\nindustrial-, and service-based economies, the growth of cities and urbanization\nof rural areas are now irreversible. Moreover, another phase of transformation is\nunder way, involving global processes of economic, cultural, and political changes.\n\nWithin the cities of the developed world, the economic reorganization has\ndetermined a selective recentralization of residential and commercial land use\nconnected especially with a selective industrial decentralization. In contrast to\nthe core regions, where urbanization has largely resulted from economic growth,\nthe urbanization of peripheral regions has been a consequence of demographic\ngrowth, generating large increases in population (overurbanization) well in\nadvance of any significant levels of urban or rural economic development.

Solid waste that is buried\nbeneath the ground can, overtime, begin to pollute the groundwater below it.\nWater percolating downward through the rubbish can pick up harmful pollutants\nand deposit them in subsurface water sources. These groundwater reservoirs feed\nsurface streams and are also tapped for well water. In the state of Florida, for\nexample, the pollution of groundwater reservoirs, known as aquifers, is a significant\nissue because the state relies heavily on groundwater for its water supply.\n\nThree primary solutions to the problem of solid wastes is disposal in landfills,\nincineration of the trash, or recycling. In the United States, solid waste collectors\npick up trash in cities and neighborhoods and transports the waste to landfills\nwhere it is buried daily to decrease the pervasive odor and protect il from marauding\npests. This is the most common method of dealing with solid waste in the United\nStates, but unfortunately, as urban sprawl expands towards areas where landfills\nwere on the periphery of populated areas, the matter of residents having to live\nclose to landfills is problematic. Moreover, landfills require extensive areas of land,\nand in some states with heavy population concentrations such as New York City,\ngovernment officials have resorted to shipping their refuse into adjacent states\nsuch as Pennsytvania where space for landfills is more available.\n\nAnother less common alternative to landfills is incineration, a process made\nfamous in Disney's Toy Story 2 (Figure 19.7).

Common wastes that are recycled include paper products,\nmetals, plastics, and glass. In the United States, efforts to improve the percent of\nwaste material that is recycled instead of disposed of in trash disposal units are\nmany.

Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, GA, is one of the many\ncompetitors in Recyclemania every spring. Despite efforts such as these, the United\nStates only recycles about 30 percent of solid waste, even though approximately 75\npercent of the waste is recyclable. In contrast, Germany recycles about 65 percent\nof its municipal waste and leads the world, followed closely by South Korea at 59\npercent.
